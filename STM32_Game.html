                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    Using the STMCubeMX ide, direct manipulation of the STM32 Discovery board registers achieved to create a simple
                                    game played through the terminal.  The goal of this game is to use the STM32 on board gyroscope to move a 
                                    cursor’s position through a 20x40 game field and match position with a target.  The position of this target 
                                    is randomly generated.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    The game consists of 6 levels. Each level having less and less time to match position. A level consists of 5 
                                    stages. The five stages all have different target positions which a player must match and hold the cursor on the
                                    target till the time is up. If they are successful they score points for that stage, and repeat till all stages
                                    are completed. At the end of the level, if no points are scored, the game is over. Otherwise, a player can play 
                                    through all 6 levels before the game is up.

                                <h3><strong>Analysis / Design:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The design of this game can be broken into two overall components: the calculation of absolute angle using gyroscopic 
                                    reading, and the game board display using serial UART communication.  All game operations are dictated by the game clock 
                                    which ticks once every 100ms.  This clock is controlled by TIM2 with a prescaler of 7999 (HCLK is 80MHz) and a Period 
                                    of 1000.  Interrupts are enabled for this timer and the game clock is iterated using the “period elapsed” callback 
                                    function (HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim)).
                                    <br><br>
                                    Each game cycle, the current reading from the gyroscope in the X and Y rotational directions are taken into account.  
                                    If the reading for a particular direction exceeds +/- 500, the rotation is considered significant and so the current 
                                    cursor position increments either positively or negatively.  This is not exactly an absolute angle as an abrupt change 
                                    in board angle will not cause a larger movement in the cursor than a less abrupt change.  However, assuming a user 
                                    changes the board angle without any sharp jerks, this design choice is a usable approximation of absolute angle. Upon 
                                    accounting for the user movement, a series of checks is completed to determine if it is the end of a stage, end of a 
                                    level, or even end of a game. If necessary, scores are processed and the respective next stage, next level or end of 
                                    game display is broadcasted to the user. The game cycles state diagram can be found in the appendix under <b><i>fig. 1</i></b>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In terms of the game board, the usual UART control hardware was enabled in CubeMX.  In order to control this game 
                                    board, ASCII escape sequences were used.  This allows for actions such as clearing UART terminal (and by extension 
                                    the game board) as well as changing the position of the terminal cursor.  This second escape sequence is important 
                                    as it allows the programmer to update the board with as little operations as possible, targeting the specific location 
                                    which needs to be changed.  The cursor is represented by a “□” character whereas the target is represented as a “⛋” 
                                    character.  The game cursor also maintains a tail behind it which illustrates its past movement.  This is implemented 
                                    with three dots: a capital “O” closest to the tail, then a lowercase “o” and finally a dot (“.”).

                                <h3><strong>Test Plan:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    There were a number of tests planned to make sure the design was working as intended.  Before the actual testing of 
                                    the game itself, it would be confirmed with a simple uart print that TIM2 was indeed updating the game clock at the 
                                    proper speed.  This would be done by using a cell phone timer and checking approximately how long it took the game 
                                    clock to increment by 20 (should be 2 seconds). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In terms of the game itself a number of tests were planned.  Can the user move the cursor around the game board 
                                    easily?  This ensured proper reading of the gyroscope.  It was also planned to test whether the user would be able 
                                    to escape the game board (which they should not be able to do).  If this appeared to work the user would then attempt 
                                    to play the game.  First they would fail on the first level and ensure proper response.  Then, they would try to complete 
                                    the game successfully and again ensure that the levels worked and the scored screen was appropriate (it was unlikely 
                                    that the game could be fully beaten through level 6).  While doing this the user would assure that the target positions 
                                    appeared to be picked randomly and that the time the user was provided decreased as the level increased.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The results were more or less as expected.  The game worked as designed and tests were almost entirely successful.  
                                    There did appear to be one issue with the game.  If the uart terminal is too large, the game will allow the cursor 
                                    to escape off the top of the game board.  This however, does not happen for smaller screen sizes.  Otherwise, the 
                                    game plays as expected, tilting the board causing incremental change in the cursor and the game is easily playable.

                                <h3><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    Escape sequences were a new thing in this project. As mentioned above, being able to update the board without having to 
                                    reprint a whole new board every iteration made  these sequences critical. At first it was a challenge to get the proper 
                                    setup for the sequences to work. Many failed attempts occurred before finally achieving proper functionality. For one, 
                                    the cursor set position sequence does not start at 0,0.  It starts at 1, 2 (x and y respectively). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The gyroscope was an interesting, but cool portion to tackle. The gyroscope was a difficult one to achieve proper 
                                    functionality. To convert the raw data from angular velocity to angular acceleration proved much difficulty. So a 
                                    simple solution described in the documentation above was used to overcome the problem. Secondly, at the beginning of 
                                    the project, the plan was to use freeRTOS and threading. Though for some reason, with freeRTOS, and the gyroscope being 
                                    implemented, no interrupts could be used. When testing to verify the interrupts using just freeRTOS, or just the 
                                    gyroscope, no issues emerged, and they worked fine. So ditching the threading was the only effective option.
