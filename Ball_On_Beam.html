                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    After taking systems, signals and transforms, I became fascinated by the frequency domain. It was mind 
                                    blowing to me that applying a simple set of equations, a signal could be manipulated in a whole new manor 
                                    to reveal information that cannot be seen in the time domain. The only course I had left in the curriculum 
                                    that related to these topics was digital signal processing. However, I had a free space left in my schedule 
                                    senior year, and I decided to fill it with a class that allowed me to explore the frequency domain some 
                                    more. A conversation with my signals professor lead me to Control Systems. A class that I could learn more 
                                    about using Laplace transforms, and the frequency domain, in order to produce systems that normally seem 
                                    like they can’t be controlled.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In order to better understand the topics covered in lecture, the lab assignments involved building a ball 
                                    on beam balance system. A seemingly simple task, where a ball is set on a beam, and it must stay in one spot. 
                                    A human should then be able to tap the ball out of place, and the system to automatically adjust for the 
                                    disturbance. In theory, this seemed simple, but in reality, it was much more complex.  First, the design 
                                    involved simple DC motors, that when a voltage is applied, spin either forward, or backwards. They aren’t 
                                    like servo motors, that given a specific pulse width, they will move to an exact location. Second, as 
                                    discovered in the later sections, the process of tuning these systems is iterative and systematic in nature. 
                                    That is, it takes time, and is not very fun.

                                <h3><strong>Analysis / Design:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The process began with developing solid control over the motor. Being able to have fine position control 
                                    would be a necessity for this project, as any error here will have effects on the system further down the 
                                    line. By attaching an encoder to the back of the motor, the current velocity of the motors shaft could be 
                                    determined, and taking the derivative, the position of the motors shaft. The initial plan was to have the 
                                    control system for motor position to be cascaded. Using the velocity error to control the inner loop, and 
                                    the position error to control the outer loop. The idea was to simplify the complexity of the design process 
                                    as much as possible, however noise in the system caused too many issues with this design. A simple solution 
                                    was to ignore the cascade, and create a basic closed loop system that used positional error, fed into a PID, 
                                    to determine the amount of voltage that would be applied to the motor. Modeling the motor itself, as well 
                                    as the control loop on MATLAB, variables for proportional, derivative, and integral control were determined. 
                                    <br><br><br>
                                    <!-- <p><span class="image right fit"><img src="images/Ball_On_Beam/TrapVelRef.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
                                    <img src="images/Ball_On_Beam/TrapVelRef.jpg" alt="" style="float:left"/>
                                    The results of the motor control loop are shown to the left by using a trapezoidal reference. Doing some basic 
                                    physics, it can be shown that a trapezoidal like velocity wave (shown in light blue) can produce a position 
                                    that gradually increases to a specific point, and then recedes back to the starting position (shown in 
                                    green). By applying the position curve to the motor control system, a judgement can be made on how accurate 
                                    the system is. The jagged dark blue lines show the actual motor velocity. Though at times it may be seemingly 
                                    to fast or to slow than what it should be, the resulting position (shown in orange) is almost spot on.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now that the motor can be controlled as if it was a servo, the next step is to determine the position of 
                                    the ball, so that the motor knows where to move to.  First, the plant for the ball was determined through 
                                    basic physics, and fortunately was relatively simple. The next step was the control loop for this. Since 
                                    the motor position was fine-tuned, and in theory had a gain of one, a decision was made to cascade this. 
                                    By doing so, the block containing the motor plant and controller designed earlier could be ignored in order 
                                    to tune whatever components needed for the ball plant. Starting off with the model in MATLAB, and just a PID 
                                    controller, several different variations of parameters were attempted, however, all produced either unstable 
                                    systems, or ones with a lot of over shoot and oscillation. If there was no over shoot, it tended to be 
                                    incredibly slow, taking upwards of 20 seconds to reach steady state. Neither of these options would work 
                                    for B.O.B, as it doesn’t look very cool when the ball takes a second to stabilize. Taking the system into 
                                    the frequency domain, it was discovered that a lot of these design iterations were close to unstable (hence 
                                    the oscillation). It had very few degrees of phase margin when the magnitude crossed 0dB. The quick solution 
                                    was to add a lead compensator, to boost the phase in the troubled areas. The resulting created a much more 
                                    stable system, with very minimal overshoot.

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    <img src="images/Ball_On_Beam/ImpulseResponse.jpg" alt="" style="float:right"/>
                                    After several long days of tuning and modification, a final form was discovered that was responsive, and 
                                    seemed adequate enough. The program was modified to move the ball to three separate positions on the beam. 
                                    The ball must start in the center, and hold it steady for a second (within a margin of 10 mm), once held, 
                                    it will move to the far end of the beam, hold steady for a second, then finally move to the short end of 
                                    the beam (closest to the distance sensor), hold for a second and repeat. This lead to something very 
                                    surprising, the system that seemed adequate, was actually marginally stable. That is, once is got to the 
                                    short end of the beam, the system would start to oscillate, slowly increasing, till it was out of control. 
                                    We must never forget about Tubby, and as such, the design was modified to accommodate for the instability. 
                                    To the right, is the plotted response of the system. The first highlighted bump 
                                    is the step response of the motor start up. That is going from a distance of on the long end of beam to the 
                                    center. The second highlighted bump is the result of a disturbance on the ball (me tapping it). Both result 
                                    in the ball centering out within a second, and hitting zero steady state error (within margin) within 2 
                                    seconds.

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    Having expanded my knowledge and intrest in control systems after completing this project, I decided to dive 
                                    deeper into the subject. The ball on beam system worked exceptionally, a faster response time than I could've 
                                    imagine, with impeccable position/motor control. The fact that it is my senior year, I wanted to create 
                                    something that implemented a summary of my knowledge that I have gained attending RIT. Having taken several 
                                    classes on microcontrollers, object orientated program, and messing around with computer vision, I decided to 
                                    create B.O.B2. The idea was to add a secondary axis to the ball on beam mechanism, and as a result, be able to 
                                    control a flat plan. This could then be coded to not only balance the ball in the center, but create simple 
                                    algorithms to move the ball in circles, or even implement a drawing pad. So a user could trace out a path on 
                                    the plate that the ball must follow. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first step was redesigning the base. I needed something that I could not only implement the ball on a 
                                    plate design, but since the semester labs involved a ball on a beam, it must also be able to accommodate for 
                                    that. After a few quick sketch ups, and a trip to the on campus laser printer, B.O.B2 started to come alive.

                                    The next step was determining the ball location on the board. There are several different ways to go about this, 
                                    but I decided to approach it using computer vision. I wrote up a script in python with a basic PyQt GUI that 
                                    would allow me to test out various color spaces for masking (H,S,V or Y,Cr,Cb specifically as these are light 
                                    independent). With this software I can either manually determine the color space mask values, or automatically 
                                    determine them for the system. The resulting application would then be able to then determine the center 
                                    position of the ball relative to the camera. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Ball_On_Beam/BallTracking.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    <br>
                                    I settled on HSV color space, as it seemed to do the best with masking for the orange ball that was given to us. 
                                    Additionally, the convince of the hue and saturation being light dependent means that no matter the environment 
                                    I am in, the lighting won’t change the needed mask. I added an option to display extra images showing each 
                                    individual H, S, and V value of an image, as well as a brightness adjustment slider. It can be seen that as the 
                                    brightness changes in the photo, the only channel effected is the value channel in the images color space. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    Currently, the balls centroid can be determined relative to a camera, however it needs to be relative to the real 
                                    world. To do such, the camera intrinsic values are needed, as well as a marker in the real world to know how the 
                                    camera is positioned in world coordinates. Fiducial tags will give the latter, and a deep dive was done into 
                                    April tags. However it was discovered there aren’t too many libraries available for python and april tags for 
                                    windows (they’re everywhere for linux), so a different fiducial tag is needed. I stumbled upon ArUco tags which 
                                    are similar, but computationally much faster. Additionally, they used the open cv library that I already was 
                                    accessing in order to do the color masking operations. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    When it came time to do camera calibration, a checkerboard pattern was needed, and that’s when I discovered 
                                    ChArUco boards. These boards combine the checkerboard pattern needed for camera calibration, along with the ArUco 
                                    tags themselves. The resulting is higher precision pose estimation, as well as being able to use the same tags 
                                    to calibrate the camera.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Since the GUI was designed using sudo object orientated programing (as python you can’t due true OOP design), 
                                    as well as implemented in a MVC structurer, I was able to easily adapt a new view to accommodate for the ChArUco 
                                    board detection. The results were phenomenal, fast processing, high precision, as well as being able to occlude 
                                    several tags, and still being able to calculate an accurate pose.

                                    Unfortunately, due to time constraints, and several class projects that needed completion, B.O.B<sup>2</sup> was not 
                                    completed at the time of this report, however plans to finish it off over the summer are in way, and we 
                                    should be seeing him come to life sometime towards the end of 2022. The next step is simply tuning the position 
                                    control for the secondary motor, and in theory, all that has to be done is split the x and y axis. One motor 
                                    gets x, one motor gets y, and they both try to center the ball. It sounds simple, though after trying to 
                                    accomplish the ball on beam, I know it will end up being a larger task than it seems, which I am now ready 
                                    to accomplish after taking control systems.

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The system as a whole was an incredible learning experience. Understanding how very small changes in proportional, derivative, and integral change, could drastically effect the whole system was indeed an annoyance. Even so, it was cool seeing how a few mathematical terms could produce control over something that seems uncontrollable. Additionally, the class brought me together with a few other students that I had never met before until now. It helped drastically when it came time to implement compensators. We all had a different idea, and a different approach, but we all were going through the same pain of the iterative design process. One of us would discover something new about a lead or lag compensator, or even the PID. Within the hour someone else would run into an issue that you could then be able to explain why that was happening based on your own recent discovery. This formulated an incredible learning environment even in the toughest of times.
