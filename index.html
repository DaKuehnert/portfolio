									Growing up, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was big into whitewater kayaking, and I loved the outdoors. Being out on
									the water was where I belonged, but as highschool came around, I discovered fun in programming and math. The problem solving nature of the two is
									what attracted me, they were nothing more than puzzles. Complex, and confusing looking, though all have a structure, a route, a way to be solved.
									Math was nice, as there was one answer, it was black and white, no need to question a result when you can prove its validity. Programming on the
									other hand, still black and white in a way, but allowed for more of an open interpretation. I could take numerous routes, but the end conclusion
									was always the same. Some may have been faster, some may have been easier, though as long as the program met project requirements, everything was good.
									<br><br>
									Whitewater is nothing but problem solving. While racing internationally on the U23 USA team, I would compete on rivers I had never paddled. I had 
									to read the water and determine the fastest and most plausible lines through a sequence of gates set up the night before competition. If you messed 
									up, it was real time problem solving to get you back on path. The same tracks for other disciplines of whitewater kayaking as well that I have been 
									highly involved in. Creek boating, where you are running waterfalls, and even playboating, where you are stuck in a small boat performing tricks in a hydraulic. 
									<br><br>
									The problem solving nature that drove me to whitewater is what drove me to explore math and programming, and with that, I seeked to explore it further
									in my secondary education. While completing my degree, I realized the knowledge came with possibilities of expanding technology in new ways to benefit
									kayakers. Be it navigating, safety, river conservation, or just expanding the community as a whole. For now, I spend my summers instructing youth whitewater 
									camps, and volunteering at the place I grew up paddling. Doing my best to share the world of kayaking with my local community.
									<br><br>
									After graduating, my goal is to be able to use the knowledge I have learned, and have yet to learn, to help improve the quality of life for others. 
									As well as working towards and expanding practices that are beneficial to our environment. Be it directly or indirectly, I strive to leave some sort of 
									imprint of improvement for humanity before my time is up.
