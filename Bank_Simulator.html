                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    Using a bare-metal (no-operating system) program, direct manipulation of the STM32 Discovery board 
                                    registers and implementation of the FreeRTOS environment, a bank emulator was developed. The simulation 
                                    represented a bank in real time with several tellers serving customers that arrived at the bank. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The customers were randomly generated every one to four simulation minutes, and placed into the queue. 
                                    Upon hitting the front of the queue, one of three tellers would serve the customer. The time it took for 
                                    a customer to be served was represented by a random value between 30 seconds and eight simulation minutes. 
                                    The bank ran for seven simulated hours, and the tellers were allowed to take humane intermittent breaks.
                                    <br><br>  
                                    Upon completion of the simulation, metrics were gathered and displayed to the user. These metrics included 
                                    the number of customers who entered the bank and how many each teller served. The average and maximum time 
                                    a customer waits in a queue and with a given teller. The average and maximum time a teller sits idle. The 
                                    maximum transaction time for each teller, and the maximum depth of all the customer queue. Additionally, 
                                    metrics for the number of breaks for each teller, average break time, longest break time, and shortest 
                                    break time is included for the graduate extension.

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The first step was to create a few functional threads to get an idea of how FreeRTOS works. Using the 
                                    STMCube IDE, the creation was relatively simple. One chooses the stack size, and name, and the thread 
                                    is generated for you. Four threads were created. One for each teller, and one main thread to compute 
                                    the final results for display. Once a simple print was successfully displayed by each individual 
                                    thread, the process to get the mutex working began.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The mutex, as was the thread, were convenient to produce, as the IDE did all the heavy work. In the 
                                    main configuration, a mutex was created to handle the run data collection. This run data would store 
                                    all real time information of the current simulation. To keep threads from trying to simultaneously 
                                    change the run data, a mutex was going to be needed. Trying to get a simplified mutex to work was the 
                                    first discovery of issues we had when trying to complete this lab. When trying to have a value 
                                    incremented within the mutex one at a time by an individual thread, only one thread was allowed to 
                                    access the mutex. Though confident that the code was right, we were unsure of what the issue was. As 
                                    talked about later, an increase in stack size of the thread solved this issue.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The final step before implementing our project design was to create a queue. Using the queue creation 
                                    from the FreeRTOS inside the main configuration window allowed for this to be done quick and 
                                    efficiently. Instead of creating a linked list using pointers and arrays, the FreeRTOS queue has 
                                    everything necessary already implemented. Enqueuing and Dequeuing was all a matter of calling a premade 
                                    Get and Put function. The second benefit of using the premade queue was that it had a built in mutex. 
                                    So, no need to fuss around with getting a second mutex up and running properly. A thread will just wait 
                                    till it has the flag to access the queue and continue with its process.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now that all individual components were able to be developed and ran successfully on their own, the 
                                    project design (found in the appendix <b><i>fig. 1</i></b>) was able to be developed. Using a 100ms interrupts to 
                                    simulate one minute bank time, a runtime counter is started in the main before starting each thread. 
                                    Once the threads begin, the Tellers will start trying to pull customers from the queue, though at this 
                                    point none have been generated.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The main thread (<b><i>fig. 2</i></b>) runs through a while loop upon initiation and won’t stop running until seven 
                                    simulated hours are up. While in the while loop, it creates a customer, place’s it in the queue and 
                                    then creates a random wait time to determine how long it should wait till the next customer needs to 
                                    be created. Once the simulation time is up, it exits the loop and waits for the individual teller 
                                    threads to finish up processing all the customers in queue. At this point the thread calculates and 
                                    print’s out all pertinent information for the project statistics, and the code completes.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The three teller threads (<b><i>fig. 3</i></b>) have identical code with variation in variable names. The concept 
                                    behind the teller thread is if there are customers in the queue and the bank is still running, the 
                                    thread will be up and going. Inside the conditional while loop, three states exist. One for the teller 
                                    being Idle, one for when it is busy and one for when it is on break. During its idle state, the teller 
                                    handles adjusting metrics, trying to pull a new customer, or checking if it is time for a break. The 
                                    idle state is left if a new customer appears in the queue for them to serve or the allotted random 
                                    wait time between thirty to sixty minutes is up meaning it is now headed to the break state. Upon 
                                    completion of serving all customers and the bank is now closed, the thread acquires the run data mutex, 
                                    uploads all of its individual statistics and enters an infinite null loop representing the fact it no 
                                    longer exists.

                                <h3><strong>Test Plan:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The first test completed for this project was a verification that each individual component worked. That is, 
                                    threads could be run by themselves, mutex’s could be acquired by one and then multiple threads, and queues 
                                    could be properly implemented. Upon successful verification of this, the project was allowed to move forward.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The second test was getting a single thread to run a simplified bank environment. That is the bank time was 
                                    shorter, less customers were generated with at a constant rate, and the teller did not include breaks. The 
                                    data pulled from the test verified that the teller was working properly, and the data being produced was of 
                                    accuracy. No problems were discovered here so an addition of breaks was added. No noticeable errors occurred 
                                    at the end of testing a single teller and main.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    The third test was to implement all three tellers with no breaks, and no random values. This way data being 
                                    produced could be verified. Problems of stack size and heap size were discovered at this test, and for a 
                                    while only two of three threads would run properly. Once fully functioning without random variables, the 
                                    test was determined complete.
                                    <br><br> 
                                    The final test was to introduce random variables. Upon successful completion of this test would mean the 
                                    project is complete and ready for submission. Though this is where we got stuck and ran into more issues. 
                                    An introduction of random variables resulted in a data that was clearly far from being accurate. So, a 
                                    reduction of a teller was done for testing. The data printed out was reasonable except for a few notable 
                                    exceptions. Typically, it was the same variable that were seemingly off, but this would very simulation 
                                    to simulation. When reduced down to a single teller with random variables, the data was accurate with no 
                                    noticeable flaws.

                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    The final result of the project was not up to specifications. As mentioned in the paragraph above, running a 
                                    single teller, all statistical data printed out was accurate with no errors. When two tellers were run, the 
                                    simulation worked with a very minute number of flaws that happened randomly to various variables. When all 
                                    three tellers (as per project specifications) were run, the resulting data was noticeably inaccurate across 
                                    the board.
                                </p>

                                <h3><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></h3>
                                <p style="text-align:left;">
                                    This project taught several lessons on the FreeRTOS environment. The first was proper creation and handling 
                                    of threads and mutex’s. Not knowing if the creation by the IDE was accurate, much debugging was done to verify 
                                    that these were working properly. Multiple problems were discovered along the way that had nothing to do with 
                                    the creation, but did result in useful knowledge used as solution in later parts of the lab. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first thing discovered for threads was the priority level. Within the Cube IDE, if the priority levels 
                                    were set at different levels (low, medium, high) not all threads would run. Initially, our main thread was 
                                    set to medium priority, and our teller threads were set to low. Compilation of the software would result in 
                                    the main thread being allowed to run, and only the first of three tellers we had created. When setting the 
                                    priorities to all medium, the threads were able to execute properly.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The second discovery was when the mutex was not able to be accessed by all of the threads. This one was very 
                                    confusing as only one teller could ever access the mutex and configure the data, while the other threads sat 
                                    seemingly idle. Each thread was identical other than their name and variable of modification inside the mutex, 
                                    so no solution was immediately clear. Upon initializing the threads in a different order, whatever the first 
                                    thread created was would be the thread allowed to access the mutex. The solution to this error was discovered 
                                    to be the stack sizes of the threads. When increased from 128 bits to 256 bits for all threads, the mutex was 
                                    able to be properly acquired and modified by all threads.
                                    <br><br>
                                    At one point in our program, data had started to become very inaccurate. What was strange was the only thing 
                                    that had been changed was the addition of a print statement. When the print statement was removed the program 
                                    may work again but would randomly start to produce inaccurate data after a few more tests were run and a few 
                                    lines were changed. The inaccurate data was inconsistent and was not able to be tied to a single issue. Though 
                                    this time it was known not to be stack sizes, as each individual thread still ran without an issue. The 
                                    solution was an increased in heap size allocated by the program. In the main configuration window of the Cube 
                                    IDE, under the freeRTOS tab, a convenient display of data is shown. The amount of heap size allocated is 
                                    available to be changed, and the amount currently being used by the given code is shown. We increased this 
                                    from three thousand bits to five thousand and noticed that we no longer had random data being displayed when 
                                    it shouldn’t.

                                    The final discovery made was the addition of random variables requires a hefty increase in stack size. This 
                                    makes perfect since, though was not something we thought of at first. We completed the program without using 
                                    random variables so that we could verify the collection of data. Once we verified accuracy, the random variables 
                                    were created, and random parts of the program would cause errors. After much digging, we increased the stack 
                                    size of each thread to 384 bits, and the program started running normal again.

                                    With all that we learned, none of these were solutions to fixing our final version of our project. Since 
                                    we could not get the simulation to function properly with all three tellers, we tried to adjust the stack 
                                    memory of the threads and had no luck. When checking the allocated heap memory, clearly it was shown we had 
                                    more than enough available, so checks were done to decrease the heap as well as increasing the heap. Neither 
                                    worked out and no solution could be discovered as to why the introduction of a second and third teller would 
                                    significantly change the resulting data output.
